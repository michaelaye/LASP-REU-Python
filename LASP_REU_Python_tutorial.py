# # MANY important non-standard packages

# ![Science stack](science_stack.jpg "Science stack")

# ![ecosytem](python_ecosystem.png "Ecosytem")

# ## Which Python distribution?
# * Currently best supported is Anaconda by Continuum.io
# * Works on the major three operating systems
# * Comes with the most important science packages pre-installed.

# ## Getting started
# The following launches the Python interpreter in `interactive` mode:
# ```bash
# $ python
# Python 3.5.1 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec  7 2015, 11:24:55)
# [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577)] on darwin
# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
# >>> print('hello world!')
# hello world!
# ```

# ## To leave Python:
# ```bash
# >>> <Ctrl-D>
# $ 
# ```

# ## Run an existing script file with Python code
# This is running Python code `non-interactive`:
# ```bash
# $ python script_name.py
# [...output...]
# ```
# * Python itself can be run interactively, but not many features.
# * -> Fernando PÃ©rez, then at CU Boulder, invents IPython, a more powerful interactive environment for Python.

# ## Launching IPython
# Launching works the same way:
# ```bash
# $ ipython
# Python 3.5.1 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec  7 2015, 11:24:55)
# Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
# 
# IPython 4.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.
# ?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.
# %quickref -> Quick reference.
# help      -> Python's own help system.
# object?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.
# Automatic calling is: Smart
# 
# In [1]:
# ```

# # Most important IPython features
# * Tab completion for Python modules
# * Tab completion for object's attributes ("introspection")
# * automatic reload possible of things you are working on.

# # Latest technology jump: IPython notebook (Now Jupyter)
# 
# * Cell-based interactivity
# * Combining codes with output including plot display **AND** documentation (like this!)
# * Very successful. Received twice Sloan foundation funding (here to stay!)
# * Became recently language agnostic: JU_lia, PYT_hon, R (and many many more)

# # My recommendation
# * Work with IPython for quick things that don't need plots or on slow remote connection
# * Work with Jupyter notebook for interactive data analysis and to develop working code blocks
# * Put working code blocks together into script files for science production and run "non-interactive"

# # Launching Jupyter notebook
# ```bash
# $ jupyter notebook
# [I 16:27:34.880 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/klay6683/src/RISE
# [I 16:27:34.880 NotebookApp] 0 active kernels
# [I 16:27:34.880 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at: http://localhost:8889/
# [I 16:27:34.881 NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
# ```
# * Will launch what is called a "notebook server" and open web browser with dash-board
# * This server pipes web browser cells to the underlying Python interpreter.

# # And here we are!
# ## Now let's do some Python!
# First, let's look at variables

# In[ ]:

a = 5
s = 'mystring'   # both single and double quotes are okay.
# new comment


# Python is `dynamically typed`, meaning I can change the type of any variable at any time:

# In[ ]:

a = 'astring'
print(a)   # not the last line, so if I want to see it, I need to use the print() function.
s = 23.1
s  # note that if the last line of any Jupyter cell contains a printable object, it will be printed.


# Python is written in C, therefore uses many of the same technicalities.
# 
# For examples, one equal sign `=` is used for value assignment, while two `==` are used for equality checking:

# In[ ]:

a = 5
a


# In[ ]:

a == 5


# Storing more than one item is done in `lists`.
# 
# A list is only one of Python's `containers`, and it is very flexible, it can store any Python object.

# In[ ]:

mylist = [1, 3.4, 'hello', 3, 6]
mylist


# Each item can be accessed by an 0-based index (like in C):

# In[ ]:

print(mylist[0])
print(mylist[2])
len(mylist)


# One can get slices of lists by providing 2 indices, with the right limit being exclusive, not inclusive

# In[ ]:

i = 2
print(mylist[:i])
print(mylist[i:])


# ### Sensible multiplication
# Most Python objects can be multiplied, in the most logical sense depending on its type:

# In[ ]:

a = 5
s = 'mystring'
mylist = [1,2]


# In[ ]:

print(5*a)
print(2*s)
print(3*mylist)


# ### Conditional branching: if statement

# In[ ]:

temp = 80
if temp > 110:
    print("It's too hot.")
elif temp > 95 and temp < 110:  # test conditions are combined with `and`
    print("It's okay.")
else:
    print("Could be warmer.")
# See how I use double quotes here to avoid ambiguity with single quote in the string.


# ### Functions
# 
# Functions are called with `()` to contain the arguments for a function. 
# 
# We already used one: `print()`
# 
# Learn about function's abilitys using IPython's help system. It is accessed by adding a question mark to any function name. In Jupyter notebooks, a sub-window will open. When done reading, close it by pressing `q` or clicking the x icon:

# In[ ]:

get_ipython().magic('pinfo print')


# #### Making your own function
# 
# This is very easy, with using the keyword `def` for "define":

# In[ ]:

def myfunc(something):  # note how I don't care about the type here!
    """Print the length of `something` and print itself."""
    print("Length:", len(something))   # all `something` needs to support is to have a length
    print("You gave:", something)


# In[ ]:

myfunc('mystring')


# In[ ]:

myfunc(['a', 1, 2])


# In[ ]:

myfunc(5)


# The principle of not defining a required type for a function, but require an `ability` is very important in Python and is called `duck typing`:
# 
# > "In other words, don't check whether it IS-a duck: check whether it QUACKS-like-a duck, WALKS-like-a duck, etc, etc, depending on exactly what subset of duck-like behaviour you need to play your language-games with."

# ## Loops
# 
# Loops are the kings of programming, because they are the main reason why we do programming:
# 
# > Execute tasks repeatedly, stop when conditions are fulfilled.
# 
# These conditions could be simply that data are exhausted, or a mathematical condition.
# 
# 2 main loops exist: The more basic `while` loop, and the more advanced `for` loop.
# 
# ### while loops
# 
# `while` loops run until their conditional changes from True to False.
# 
# The loop is only entered when the condition is True.
# 
# Note how in Python sub blocks of code are defined simply by indentation and the previous line
# ending with a colon `:`.

# In[ ]:

i = 0
while i < 3:  # this is the condition that is being checked.
    print(i, end=' ')
    i = i + 1   # very common statement, read it from right to left!
print('Done')


# In[ ]:

i < 3


# In[ ]:

i


# `while` loops are the most low level loops, they always can be made to work, as you design the interruption criteria yourself.
# 
# ### For loops
# 
# `for` loops are designed to loop over containers, like lists.
# 
# They know how to get each element and know when to stop:

# In[ ]:

mylist = [5, 'hello', 23.1]
for item in mylist:
    print(item)


# The "`in`" keyword is a powerful and nicely readable concept in Python.
# 
# In most cases, one can check ownership of an element in a container with it:

# In[ ]:

5 in mylist


# ### The `range()` function
# 
# `range()` is very useful for creating lists for you that you can loop over and work with.
# 
# It has two different call signatures:
# 
# * range(n) will create a list from 0 to n-1, with an increment of +1.
# * range(n1, n2, [step]) creates a list from n1 to n2-1, with again a default increment of 1
# 
# Negative increments are also okay:

# In[ ]:

for i in range(10):
    print(i, end=' ')


# In[ ]:

for i in range(2, 5):
    print(i, end=' ')


# In[ ]:

for i in range(0, -5, -1):
    print(i, end=' ')


# In[ ]:

get_ipython().magic('pinfo range')


# **IMPORTANT**
# 
# Note, that for memory efficiency, `range()` is not automatically creating the full list, but returns an object called a `generator`.
# 
# This is basically an abstract object that knows **HOW TO** create the requested list, but didn't do it yet.

# In[ ]:

print(range(10))


# It takes either a loop (as above) or a conversion to a list to see the actual content:

# In[ ]:

print(list(range(10)))


# ### Combine `if` and `for`
# 
# Let's combine `for` and `if` to write a mini program.
# The task is to scan a container of 1's and 0's and count how many 1's are there.

# In[ ]:

mylist = [0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1]
mylist


# In[ ]:

one_counter = 0
for value in mylist:       # note the colon!
    if value == 1:         # note the indent for each `block` !
        one_counter += 1   # this is the short version of a = a + 1
print("Found", one_counter, "ones.")


# ### Writing and reading files
# 
# Need to get data in and out.
# In principle, I recommend to use high level readers from science packages.
# 
# But you will need to know the principles of file opening nonetheless.

# In[ ]:

afile = open('testfile', 'w')


# In[ ]:

get_ipython().magic('pinfo afile.name')


# In[ ]:

afile.write('some text \n')   # \n is the symbol to create a new line
afile.write('write some more \n')


# The `write` function of the `afile` object returns the length of what just was written.
# 
# When done, the file needs to be closed!
# 
# Otherwise, the content could not end up in the file, because it was `cached`.

# In[ ]:

afile.close()


# I can call operating system commands with a leading exclamation mark:

# In[ ]:

get_ipython().system('cat testfile')


# #### reading the file
# 
# One can also use a so called `context manager` and indented code block to indicate to Python when to automatically close the file:

# In[ ]:

with open('testfile', 'r') as afile:
    print(afile.readlines())


# In[ ]:

with open('testfile', 'r') as afile:
    print(afile.read())


# ### Tutorial practice
# 
# Now you will practice a bit of Python yourself.
# 
# I recommend to join forces in groups of two.
# 
# This working technique is called "pair programming": 
# One person is the "driver", typing in code, while the other person is the "navigator", reviewing everything that is being typed in. 
# The roles should be frequently changed (or not, depending on preferences).
# 
# This way you can discuss anything that's being worked on.
# 
# Next session we will learn how to import all these powerful analysis packages into a Python session, learn about the most import science packages and play with some real data.
